## Flip Demo

This is a small demo built with vue cli to test [flip](https://www.github.com/SSENSE/flip), a react to vue transpiler. To start it, just run `yarn install` and then `yarn serve`.

If you'd like to play around with the transpiler, you can edit or add the components inside `src/react-components` and then run `yarn transpile`. Once they're transpiled, you'll find them in `dist/vue`. From there, you can import them into the vue app!

This plugin is experimental, and still in it's infancy - if you find anything weird or broken, or have a feature you'd like to see, feel free to make a request [here](https://www.github.com/SSENSE/flip/issues)
